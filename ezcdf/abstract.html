EZcdf is a high-level,  easy-to-use interface to the NetCDF library
(http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf), a file format which
allows one to write/read binary files across architectures without
regard to the underlying native byte ordering. NetCDF is language
independent; files can be written in a programming language (e.g.
Fortran, C, Java, Python, IDL) and read in another. Data can be accessed
randomly so that the content of a NetCDF file can evolve without
compromising backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunetely, the complexity of NetCDF has deterred many users in the
past. While  EZcdf does not support the full capability of NetCDF, it is
almost as simple to write a NetCDF file with EZcdf as  using unformatted
read/write instructions. At present, EZcdf only supports finite sized
arrays of rank <= 3. On the other hand, EZcdf accepts complex and
logical data types, which are mapped to real, respectively integer,
arrays while providing a name mangling mechanism to overcome the lack of
support for complex and integer types in NetCDF.

EZcdf's first application was to replace BZIO calls in many PPPL codes
such as JSOLVER, DMAP, PEST and others.
